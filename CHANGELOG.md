## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Ollama local model support** — `"ollama"` added as a valid AI provider. Points to `localhost:11434/v1` with no API key required. Enables testing local models (Gemma, Qwen, DeepSeek, frankenstein merges like Qwopus) through the existing sandbox harness.
- **Universal output parser (4-pass)** — `decision_parser.rs` now handles any LLM output format:
  - Pass 0: Strip ``/`` tags (Qwen, DeepSeek reasoning models)
  - Pass 1: Strict JSON parse
  - Pass 2: Manual JSON repair (truncated strings, unclosed brackets)
  - Pass 3: Partial extraction (salvage whatever fields are available)
  - Pass 4: Regex-based freeform NLP extraction — extracts pair, prices, confidence, R:R from natural language text when JSON parsing fails entirely
- **Gasless swap fallback in close path** — When `close_position()` detects a dust output error from the standard 0x Permit2 swap (0x can't route micro-amounts), it automatically retries via the 0x Gasless API. Gasless handles approvals and gas costs internally — no ETH needed, no Permit2 approval tx. Solves the live issue where stop-losses on small positions ($20-30) couldn't execute.
- **`DexBackend` trait: gasless methods** — `build_gasless_swap_tx()` and `poll_gasless_status()` added to the `DexBackend` trait with default "not supported" implementations. `ZeroXBackend` delegates to existing gasless code. `FallbackBackend` tries primary then secondary.
- **`run-ollama-tests.ps1`** — PowerShell script for benchmarking local Ollama models against the 60-scenario sandbox. Auto-detects available models, runs each with configurable timeout, generates comparison report.
- **`regex` crate** — Added as dependency for the universal parser's freeform text extraction.

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Stop-loss execution failure on micro-amounts** — Live incident where 0.01485 WETH (~$23) stop-loss couldn't close via standard 0x swap. API returned 0 output tokens (dust). System retried every cycle for 30+ minutes without success. Gasless fallback now handles this automatically.
- **Trailing whitespace in engine.rs:5087** — `cargo fmt` internal error caused by trailing space on a `matches!()` line. Fixed manually.
- **Phantom ETH position in journal DB** — After manual WETH→USDC swap, the SQLite journal still contained the old ETH position record. Engine re-registered it on startup as a wallet-recovered position, inflating portfolio value by ~$23. Cleaned via direct DB deletion. (Wallet recovery side=SHORT bug noted for future fix.)

### Changed

- **`cargo fmt` applied project-wide** — All 43 source files reformatted to consistent style. No logic changes.
- **`.gitignore` expanded** — Added entries for: `prompt-results/`, `DEEP-RESEARCH-PROMPT.md`, `MODEL-TRAINING-RESEARCH.md`, `API-KEYS.md`, `data/sandbox_*`, `data/sandbox_reports/`, `data/model-comparison-*.md`, `data/test_memory.db*`, `LLM Crypto Trading Growth Strategy.md`.
- **Sandbox test artifacts cleaned** — Removed 15+ temp files from `data/` (sandbox stdout/stderr/output/report files, model comparison reports, test databases).
- **FID-062: Removed Kraken execution backend** — Deleted `src/execution/kraken.rs` (569 lines of dead code). `KrakenTrader` was never used for live execution. Removed Kraken match arm from engine, removed `KrakenTraderConfig`, removed Kraken balance sync. `exchange.backend = "kraken"` no longer valid — only `"0x"` and `"1inch"` accepted.
- **FID-062: Renamed data pipeline** — `KrakenClient` → `CandleClient` (`src/data/candle_client.rs`), `KrakenSource` → `KrakenFeed` (`src/data/sources/kraken.rs`). Removed 400+ lines of dead private API code (signing, order placement, balance queries). Console label "Kraken Data" → "Market Data". All variable names updated.
- **Version** — 0.9.1 → 0.10.0

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- **`savant serve` command** — Single command starts engine + API (port 8080) + Next.js dashboard (port 3000). Dashboard auto-builds if not built. `cmd /c npm` for Windows compatibility.
- **0x `/price` liquidity pre-check** — `LiquidityCheck` struct with `available`, `buy_tax_bps`, `sell_tax_bps`, `buy_amount`, `balance_ok`, `allowance_ok`. Called before every BUY and close. Honeypot detection via buy tax > 1%.
- **`sellEntireBalance` parameter** — 0x API uses actual on-chain balance at execution time. Prevents dust/rounding failures on close swaps.
- **Multi-chain token databases** — Ethereum (19 tokens), Base (14), Optimism (14). `lookup_token()` now chain-aware for 4 chains. All chains enabled in config.
- **Wallet sync (chain-first reconciliation)** — Queries on-chain ERC-20 balances for all curated pairs on startup. Creates recovery positions for untracked tokens (entry price from trade history). Removes ghost positions for tokens no longer in wallet. `entry_price > 0` guard prevents corrupted positions.
- **Equity chart** — Recharts area chart in dashboard showing equity curve over time. API endpoint `/api/equity` querying `equity_snapshots` table.
- **Activity log copy button** — Click to copy full activity log to clipboard.
- **Scrollbar styling** — Custom scrollbar matching dark design system (thin, dark track, subtle thumb).
- **12h AM/PM timestamps** — Activity log uses 12-hour format instead of 24h.
- **Rejection logging to dashboard** — Every BUY rejection (price drift, liquidity, position sizer, concentration cap) logged to activity feed with reason.
- **Log broadcast channel** — `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel captures all tracing/savant_log output. Terminal WebSocket streams to dashboard in real-time.
- **SQLite busy_timeout** — `SqlitePool::connect_with` with `busy_timeout(5s)` + WAL mode. Prevents hanging on stale locks from crashed processes.
- **Dynamic gas management** — Queries `eth_gasPrice` from network, calculates cost per swap, requires enough for 2 swaps + 50% buffer. No hardcoded gas thresholds.
- **Circuit breaker dollar floors** — `min_daily_loss_usd = $5`, `min_drawdown_usd = $10`. Prevents false halts at tiny balances.
- **Full deploy mode** — `full_deploy = true` in config. At <$500 balance, 100% of capital into best-conviction trade.
- **Dynamic R:R** — `min_rr_ratio_low_balance = 1.2` at <$50 balance (was fixed 1.5).
- **Dynamic position sizing** — Risk tiers: <$500 = 100%, <$5000 = 10%, <$50000 = 5%, above = 2%. No hardcoded percentages.
- **Gas buffer increase** — 1.5x multiplier with 800,000 minimum (was raw 0x estimate). Fixes "out of gas" on Permit2 calldata.

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Close trade failure** — `close_position()` removed position from map BEFORE swap executed. If swap failed (dust, no liquidity), tokens stranded in wallet with no tracking. Now: position stays in map until on-chain USDC balance verified.
- **CRITICAL: Equity calculation wrong** — Used `balance + unrealized_pnl` (only counts profit, not position value). Now uses `balance + sum(position_values)` (includes deployed capital). All 5 callers fixed.
- **CRITICAL: Balance double-counting** — DB position restore deducted `entry_price * quantity` from balance. But balance was already reduced when trade executed on-chain. Removed deduction.
- **CRITICAL: Wallet desync (3 incidents)** — Engine crashed before saving positions to DB. Wallet sync created ghost positions with `entry_price=0`. Fixed: chain-first reconciliation after candle data loads, `entry_price > 0` guard.
- **CRITICAL: `sell_usd` decimal bug** — Was hardcoding USDC 6-decimal math for ALL tokens (including 18-decimal UNI). Now uses correct decimals per token.
- **Pre-flight "out of gas"** — 0x API returns `gas=600000` but Permit2 needs more. Added 1.5x buffer with 800,000 minimum.
- **Timer 0m** — `engine_started_at` initialized to `Some(Instant::now())` when engine running at API startup.
- **Market insight "No data"** — Shared state not seeded after first `refresh_multi()`. Now seeds immediately and syncs every 5 ticks.
- **DB balance overwrites on-chain** — In live mode, balance comes from on-chain USDC only. DB trades loaded for history but don't override balance.
- **SQLite connection hangs** — URL parameters don't work with sqlx. Switched to `SqliteConnectOptions` with `busy_timeout`.
- **Circuit breaker block file** — Auto-deleted on `savant serve` so stale blocks don't prevent startup.
- **Windows npm not found** — `std::process::Command::new("npm")` fails on Windows. Uses `cmd /c npm` via `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]`.
- **Terminology: "DRY-RUN" → "PRE-FLIGHT"** — eth_call simulation renamed. "Paper Trading" removed from vault writer. Correct terms for live trading.
- **Dead code: `total_unrealized`** — Unused variable in paper.rs after equity calculation rewrite.
- **Clippy: `map_or` → `is_none_or`** — 0x liquidity check simplified per clippy suggestion.
- **Clippy: `single_match` → `if let`** — Token balance loop in trader.rs.
- **`prepared_for_retry` scope** — Brace fix broke sandbox function scope. Restored correct closing braces.

### Changed

- **10 curated high-liquidity pairs** — ETH, BTC, ARB, LINK, UNI, AAVE, PEPE, PENDLE, COMP, LDO (was 9 pairs including DOGE/BONK with uncertain Arbitrum liquidity).
- **Blockscout non-blocking** — For curated pairs, Blockscout check skipped entirely. For other pairs, logs warning instead of rejecting. 0x quote is the real liquidity gate.
- **`DexBackend::check_liquidity`** — Returns `LiquidityCheck` struct instead of `bool`. All backends updated (0x, 1inch, fallback).
- **`SwapParams` struct** — Added `sell_entire_balance: bool` field. All 8 construction sites updated.
- **`ExecutionEngine::check_liquidity`** — Returns `LiquidityCheck` with `available`, `buy_tax_bps`, etc.
- **Version** — 0.9.0 → 0.9.1

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- **First successful on-chain swap** — AAVE bought on Arbitrum for $9.54 (tx: 0x846d...b018e1). FLUID bought for $8.48 (tx: 0x85b0...29e9). Both confirmed on-chain.
- **Trailing stop-loss** — Auto-trails SL as price moves in our favor. Only for Full-scale positions with risk > 0. After TP1 scale-out (break-even SL), stop stays fixed.
- **CoinGecko verification gate** — DEX mode only trades tokens with CoinGecko-verified addresses. Blocks unknown/unverified tokens.
- **Position concentration cap** — Max 33% of portfolio per position. Prevents overconcentration.
- **Dead token cache** — Tokens with all-zero candle data are skipped after first failure. Retried every 10 cycles.
- **CoinGecko token filter** — Tokens not in CoinGecko Arbitrum list rejected in DEX mode.
- **Illiquid token filter** — Tokens with <5 unique close prices across 200 candles rejected.
- **`--model` CLI flag** — `cargo run -- --test --model openrouter/owl-alpha -n 20` to test any model in sandbox. Wired through `run_action_test`, `run_training`, `run_sandbox` → `run_training_batch`.
- **`--managed-keys` CLI flag** — Auto-creates temporary OpenRouter API key with $1 limit per test/training run. Uses existing `OpenRouterManagementClient`.
- **Gas buffer increase** — Gas limit 2x multiplier + 500K floor (was 1.2x). Prevents "out of gas" on Permit2 calldata.
- **Model comparison results** — Tested owl-alpha (free), DeepSeek V4 Flash, MiMo v2.5 Pro on 150 scenarios. MiMo best on Brier (0.47) and P&L (+$80.65). Owl free with 0 parse errors.

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Flawed SELL handling** — `TradeAction::Sell` was routed to close-only path. DEX can't SHORT without owning the asset. Now correctly skips with visible log.
- **CRITICAL: Short order amount_wei** — For SHORT orders, was computing `amount_to_wei(entry_price * quantity)` (USD value). Fixed to `amount_to_wei(quantity, src_decimals)` (token amount).
- **Console color system** — 12 distinct log types. LLM tags now CYAN_BOLD (was WHITE). INFO tags CYAN_BOLD (was invisible). PASS body WHITE (was dark grey). VAULT tag dim blue. WARN body matches tag.
- **R:R hallucination logging** — `[BUY REJECTED]` now shows claimed vs actual R:R with per-side computation (LONG vs SHORT).
- **SourceRouter log cleanup** — Error messages truncated to 80 chars. Pair names in dark grey brackets. Source name without redundant brackets.
- **CoinGecko filter: collapsible if** — Fixed clippy warning.

### Removed

- **GeckoTerminal from SourceRouter** — 99% failed requests, 30 req/min rate limit, zero value.
- **Dashboard scaffold** — 397MB Next.js dead weight (never used).

### Archived

- FID-045: Multi-chain 0x swap system
- FID-046: QoL improvements (7 items)
- FID-047: Sandbox model override
- FID-048: OpenRouter management key system

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Multi-chain 0x system (FID-045)** — Five phases: (1) 201 Arbitrum tokens, (2) Chain-aware database with `ChainConfig`, `ChainToken`, per-chain USDC addresses, (3) Multi-chain execution with `chain_clients` HashMap, per-chain gas monitoring, (4) Gasless API (`/gasless/quote`, `/gasless/submit`, `/gasless/status`), (5) Cross-Chain API (`/cross-chain/quotes`, `/cross-chain/status`)
- **Permit2 signature fix** — Added 32-byte signature length prefix to calldata encoding. 0x API v2 expects `calldata || sig_length (32 bytes, big-endian) || signature (65 bytes)`. Also uses API-provided `permit2.hash` field instead of computing own EIP-712 hash.
- **ERC-20 approve for Permit2** — `ensure_permit2_approval()` checks USDC/token allowance for Permit2 contract and sends approve(max) if insufficient. Called before every swap (place_order + close_position).
- **Multi-source candle architecture** — 6 active sources: Kraken, OKX, KuCoin, Gate.io, CryptoCompare, CoinGecko. 8 total sources including Binance/Bybit (geo-blocked, unused).
- **OKX candle source** — 40 req/2s, broad coverage, no API key required.
- **KuCoin candle source** — 300 req/10s, massive altcoin selection.
- **Gate.io candle source** — 300 req/s, obscure token coverage.
- **CryptoCompare candle source** — 100K calls/month, US-accessible.
- **198 Arbitrum tokens** — Real addresses from CoinGecko API `/coins/list?include_platform=true`.
- **xStock filter** — SPYX, QQQX, GLDX, CRCLX filtered (require 0x opt-in we don't have).
- **`eth_call` dry-run** — Verifies Permit2 calldata before broadcast.
- **test_swap.rs binary** — Dry-run swap verification tool.

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: ERC-20 approve for Permit2** — Missing token approval for Permit2 contract was the likely root cause of all swap failures. `ensure_permit2_approval()` now checks and sets allowance before every swap.
- **APE token address** — Was `0x7f9FBf9bDd1F0e6E2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c` (truncated placeholder). Fixed to CoinGecko-verified `0x7f9fbf9bdd3f4105c478b996b648fe6e828a1e98`.
- **AUSDT decimals** — Was 18 (wrong). aUSDT on Aave Arbitrum uses 6 decimals (same as USDT). Fixed.
- **SHORT order amount_wei** — Was computing `amount_to_wei(entry_price * quantity, decimals)` for SHORT orders, which sends the USD value instead of the token amount. Fixed: SHORT uses `amount_to_wei(quantity, src_decimals)`.
- **drain_retry_queue** — `kept` was always empty, so retries were lost after drain. Fixed to properly track entries below max_retries.
- **close_position fee accounting** — Closing fee (0.1%) was not deducted from balance on close. Now subtracts `fee_est` from proceeds.
- **FallbackBackend priority** — Was trying secondary (1inch) first, now tries primary (0x) first.
- **Quote failure aborts swap** — Previously "proceeding without spread check" on quote failure.
- **Volume filter relaxed** — Kraken spot volume irrelevant for Arbitrum DEX tokens; filter skipped in DEX mode.
- **Non-zero candle threshold** — Lowered from 50% to 30% for DEX mode.
- **SourceRouter rejects all-zero candle responses** — Kraken returning zeros for unsupported tokens no longer blocks fallback.

### Removed

- **Dead files** — Removed 35+ dead files: dashboard/ scaffold (397MB), API caches (blockscout/cg JSONs), redundant text intermediates, old handoff docs, research prompts, `firebase-debug.log`, `nul` artifact.
- **Version drift** — Fixed protocol.config.yaml version (was 0.7.1, now 0.8.0). Added default-run to Cargo.toml.

### Archived

- FID-041: Spread filter decimals
- FID-042: Permit2 signature missing
- FID-043: Trades reverting on-chain
- FID-044: Scanning under 100 pairs
- FID-045: Multi-chain 0x swap system (all 5 phases implemented)

## [0.7.1] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Token discovery** — Blockscot API integration for dynamic Arbitrum token discovery. Top 200 tokens by volume, filtered by $1M+ volume and 500+ holders.
- **Runtime token DB** — `TOKEN_EXTENSIONS` allows discovered addresses to be added at startup. `lookup_token()` checks extensions then static DB.
- **CoinGecko candle fallback** — `market_chart` endpoint gives 5m candles for 1 day (288 candles). SourceRouter tries Kraken first, CoinGecko second.
- **15s 0x API timeout** — `tokio::time::timeout(15s)` around `build_swap_tx()` prevents indefinite hangs.
- **Panic hook** — Logs `[PANIC] message at file.rs:123:45` instead of silent exit code 0xffffffff.

### Fixed

- **Tracing ANSI bleeding** — Disabled tracing colors, only `savant_log()` controls colors.
- **12h clock format** — EST timestamps now show `MM-DD-YYYY H:MM AM/PM`.
- **Pair highlighting** — `highlight_pairs()` skips already-bracketed pairs to avoid `[[BTC/USD]]`.
- **Module names** — `funding_rates` → `Funding Rates`, `onchain` → `On Chain`, `websocket` → `WebSocket`.
- **GoPlus spam** — Core assets (BTC, ETH, etc.) skip security check.
- **Vault verbosity** — Consolidated writing/done into single log line.
- **Watcher spam** — Removed per-pattern logging, only logs unique patterns.

### Archived

- FID-001: Inherited clippy lints
- FID-029: Port Kraken improvements (deferred to Preston)
- FID-030: 0x API hang
- FID-031: 0x API panic crash
- FID-032: Console color inconsistency
- FID-033: Uniform console output
- FID-034: ANSI color placement
- FID-035: Meme coin expansion
- FID-037: Console production ready
- FID-038: Arbitrum tokens + candle sources
- FID-039: Mass pair scanning
- FID-040: Full scan support

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **FID-035 Phase 3** — Dual timeframe (5m→15m aggregation, no extra API calls). KV cache optimization (`cache_control: ephemeral` on system message for OpenRouter prefix caching). Emergency liquidation CLI (`--liquidate` flag). Retry queue for failed swaps (max 3 attempts).
- **FID-035 Phase 2** — GoPlus Security API (honeypot/tax detection for meme coins). Risk buckets (macro/legacy/meme) with correlation cap. ATR-based position sizing (`calculate_with_atr()`).
- **FID-035 Phase 1** — Meme coin expansion: 13 pairs (8 core + PEPE, SHIB, FLOKI, TURBO, MOG). Spread filter (30bps max). Price tolerance (0.5% drift). `highlight_pairs()` updated.
- **FID-034** — ANSI color placement fix.
- **FID-033** — Uniform console output via custom tracing Layer.
- **Merge strategy** — `dev/MERGE-STRATEGY.md` documenting cherry-pick approach.
- **Handoff docs** — `dev/HANDOFF-OTHER-DEV.md`, `dev/AGENT-PROMPT-PRESTON.md` (archived after consumption).
- **12h EST timestamps** — `SavantTimer` for tracing subscriber, `est_now()` shared function.
- **15s timeout on 0x API** — `tokio::time::timeout(15s)` around `build_swap_tx()` prevents indefinite API hangs.

### Fixed

- **ANSI color placement (FID-034)** — Color codes placed after text in format string, so colors applied to nothing. Fixed with named format params. Capitalized module names. Stripped Debug quotes from tracing messages.
- **Uniform console output (FID-033)** — Two formatting systems running (savant_log vs tracing). Created custom `SavantLayer` tracing Layer. All output now uses `[Savant Trading] [TIME] [ACTION] [RESULT]` format with consistent colors.
- **Panic hook** — Added `std::panic::set_hook` to log panics with file:line:col before crashing. Engine now shows `[PANIC] message at file.rs:123:45` instead of silent exit code 0xffffffff.
- **Pair name highlighting** — `highlight_pairs()` now works on both bare (`BTC/USD`) and already-bracketed (`[BTC/USD]`) pairs.
- **GREY_FG color** — Changed from `\x1b[37m` (light grey = white) to `\x1b[90m` (bright black = grey).
- **Vault level brightness** — Changed from `(GREY_DIM, GREY_DIM)` to `(GREY_DIM, GREY_FG)` — result text now readable.
- **Tracing color bleeding** — tracing's ANSI codes were bleeding into `savant_log()` output. Replaced `fmt()` subscriber with custom `SavantLayer`.
- **12h clock format** — `est_timestamp()` now returns `MM-DD-YYYY H:MM AM/PM` instead of 24h format.
- **Decision reasoning truncation** — Console log truncates reasoning to 100 chars (full text in vault/episodic).
- **Clippy warnings** — Fixed 3 warnings (empty line, empty format string, `and_then` → `map`).

### Changed

- **Version bump** — 0.6.0 → 0.7.0 (cherry-picked improvements from other dev's branch)
- **Tracing subscriber** — Uses `SavantTimer` for EST timestamps, `with_ansi(false)` to prevent color bleeding.
- **Preston branch created** — `origin/preston` for other dev's Kraken porting work.

### Archived

- **FID-027** — Swap execution hang (resolved → archived)
- **FID-028** — Console logging (resolved → archived)
- **FID-025** — NVIDIA NIM provider (verified → archived)
- **Handoff docs** — MERGE-STRATEGY, HANDOFF-OTHER-DEV, AGENT-PROMPT-PRESTON (consumed → archived)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Enterprise console logging** — `src/core/console.rs` with single `savant_log()` function. Format: `[Savant Trading] [MM-DD-YYYY HH:mm] [ACTION] [RESULT]`. Cyan brand prefix, grey timestamps, white/green/orange/red results. EST timezone. 11 thin macros (`log_phase!`, `log_llm!`, `log_decision!`, `log_trade!`, `log_swap!`, `log_swap_ok!`, `log_swap_fail!`, `log_vault!`, `log_circuit!`, `log_warn!`).
- **3-retry logic for swap failures** — Retries on gas spike, nonce collision, network error, timeout. 2s delay between retries. Permanent failures (insufficient balance, invalid params) fail immediately.
- **Phantom position reconciliation** — DexTrader auto-clears positions on startup when balance drift > $1 or positions exist with zero completed trades. PaperTrader auto-reconciles when executor has no positions.
- **Position sizer logging** — Logs reason when returning None (stop/R:R invalid, entry/stop/tp1 values).
- **60s timeout on swap execution** — `tokio::time::timeout(60s)` around `place_order()` and `close_position()` prevents indefinite hangs.
- **50% gas buffer** — `maxFeePerGas = baseFee + baseFee/2 + priority` prevents `max fee per gas less than block base fee` errors on Arbitrum.
- **Kraken rebase prompt** — `dev/KRAKEN-REBASE-PROMPT.md` (385 lines) with ECHO Protocol boot sequence, file map, architecture docs, conflict zones, verification checklist.

### Fixed

- **Swap execution hang (FID-027)** — `place_order()` hung indefinitely when RPC call had no timeout. Added 60s timeout + retry logic.
- **Gas price too low** — 0x API returned stale gas estimate. Added 50% buffer to `maxFeePerGas`.
- **Console logging inconsistency (FID-028)** — Mix of `tracing` and `eprintln!`, no colors, no timestamps. Unified through `savant_log()`.
- **Clippy warnings** — Fixed 3 warnings: empty line after doc comment, empty format string, `and_then` → `map`.

### Changed

- **Version bump** — 0.5.0 → 0.6.0 (DEX execution fixes + console logging)
- **All version references updated** — Cargo.toml, VERSION, README

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **FID-026: Sell/Close action handling (critical)** — Engine ignored AI's `Sell` and `Close` decisions. All non-Hold actions (including Sell, Close) fell through to `place_order()`, which always **opened** a new position. The agent could never exit positions except via stop-loss. On DEX, this caused on-chain swap failures when the wallet didn't own the base token (nonce stayed 0). On Kraken CEX, Sell opened a new short instead of closing an existing long. Fixed by adding action-aware branching: `Sell` → finds existing position for pair → `close_position()`; `Close` → finds ALL positions for pair → `close_position()` each; `Buy` → duplicate guard before `place_order()`. Creates proper `TradeRecord` with PnL for event bus. Backend-agnostic fix (both Kraken and DEX). Verified: 187/187 tests pass, clippy clean.

### Changed

- **Version bump** — 0.4.4 → 0.5.0 (critical sell logic fix = minor version bump)
- **All version references updated** — Cargo.toml, VERSION, README, protocol.config.yaml, main.rs, vault writer, scripts, HANDOFF.md, run scripts

## [0.4.4] — 2026-06-02

### Closed (FID-016, FID-017, FID-018, FID-019, FID-020, FID-021, FID-022, FID-023, FID-024 — archived 2026-06-02)

- **FID-016: Kraken Live Trading Execution Engine** (critical) — KrakenTrader implemented with 14/16 proposed fixes. Private API client with HMAC-SHA512 signing, order placement (market/limit/stop), balance sync, daily loss halt, kill switch, slippage alerts, Discord webhook notifications. See commit `d2ab69a`. Minor gaps: partial fill tracking, sandbox mode. Status: closed → archived.

- **FID-017: Multi-Exchange DEX Integration (0x + 1inch)** (critical) — DexTrader with ZeroXBackend and InchBackend. Enterprise token resolution (symbol fallback for non-EVM tokens). EIP-1559 signing with ECHO Law 6 compliance. Docs audit fixed 4 0x API issues + 2 1inch API issues + 2 EIP-1559 critical bugs. 176 tests, clippy clean. Status: verified → closed → archived.

- **FID-023: OpenRouter LLM Provider** (high) — Added OpenRouter as first-class AI provider alongside OpenGateway. Provider factory (`create_provider()`), `extra_headers` support, `OpenRouterConfig` struct with endpoint/model/api_key_env/referer/title, config validation, engine wiring in `run()` and `dry_run()`. Zero protocol changes — same OpenAI-compatible wire format. Status: verified → closed → archived.

- **FID-024: OpenRouter Model Env Var + Management Key System** (medium) — Added `OPENROUTER_MODEL` env var override for model switching without config edits. Created `OpenRouterManagementClient` with full CRUD (list/create/get/update/delete keys) via `/api/v1/keys`. `OpenRouterManagementConfig` struct, optional engine startup wiring for key usage monitoring. Status: verified → closed → archived.

- **FID-018: DEX Production Safety** (critical) — Stop-loss persistence + re-establishment, balance reconciliation via RPC (`eth_getBalance` + USDC `balanceOf`), crash recovery via JSON state persistence (`data/dex_state.json`). ETH gas halt at <0.002 ETH. State saved on every position mutation. Status: analyzed → closed → archived.

- **FID-019: DEX Test Infrastructure** (medium) — `ZeroXBackend::with_client()` and `InchBackend::with_client()` constructor injection. `with_client_and_url()` for wiremock routing. 12 hermetic tests covering happy path, 429, 500, malformed JSON, and missing fields for both backends. All pass without API keys or network. Status: analyzed → closed → archived.

- **FID-020: TUI Code Quality** (low) — Dynamic footer reads backend, mode, budget, model from `TuiSnapshot`. Version uses `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`. Drawdown thresholds derived from config values. Status: analyzed → closed → archived.

- **FID-021: has_actionable_signal Pre-Filter Review** (medium) — EMA spread threshold 0.1% → 0.5%. VWAP deviation check wired (was dead code). Volume spike gate added (`vol / volume_sma > 1.5`).

## [0.4.3] — 2026-06-01

### Added

- **SSE Streaming LLM Provider** — `chat_stream()` for real-time response streaming via Server-Sent Events. Keeps connection alive during long reasoning (mimo v2.5 pro can take 30-90s). Parses both `delta.content` and `delta.reasoning` fields. Streaming fallback to non-streaming on failure. 180s timeout.
- **Semantic Consolidation** — `memory/semantic.rs`: SQL aggregations against episodic memory to extract regime/session/pair edge matrix, conviction calibration, category edge. Populates `semantic_patterns` table. Rolling 90-day pattern decay. PF calculated from wins/losses ratio (not pnl).
- **Anti-Pattern Detection** — `memory/anti_pattern.rs`: SQL queries for conditions where win_rate < 30%. Category-level detection via `episode_market_context.condition_tags`. Narrative constraints for prompt injection. Auto-eviction when conditions recover.
- **Multi-Asset Correlation** — `risk/correlation.rs`: Rolling Pearson correlation matrix between active pairs. Effective position counting (correlated pairs count as 1.5-2x).
- **Portfolio Heat Tracking** — `risk/circuit_breaker.rs`: Total risk exposure / equity calculation. Blocks new trades when heat > 40%. Spread width halt at 50bps.
- **Dynamic Slippage** — `execution/paper.rs`: Slippage scales with ATR volatility and order book depth. `update_atr()` and `update_book_depth()` methods.
- **Maker-Fee Routing** — `execution/paper.rs`: If spread > fee differential (10bps), posts limit order at bid/ask instead of crossing with market. Saves 10bps per trade.
- **Knowledge Lifecycle** — `agent/knowledge.rs`: `utility_score` field on KnowledgeUnit (serde default 1.0). MMR scoring adjusted: `base * (1 + log2(utility))`. `save_utility_scores()` and `load_utility_scores()` for persistence.
- **SOUL.md Evolution** — `sandbox/feedback.rs`: `<!-- MUTABLE -->` markers on Section XIII+. `extract_mutable_sections()`, `apply_mutation_to_soul()`. Teacher LLM prompts (critique + GEPA mutation). `soul_versions` table for version control with auto-rollback.
- **Train/Val Split** — `sandbox/scenarios.rs`: `load_train_scenarios()` (first 40), `load_val_scenarios()` (last 20). `load_scenarios_by_difficulty()`, `worst_category()`.
- **WS Exponential Backoff** — `data/websocket.rs`: Reconnection uses exponential backoff (1s→30s cap) with ±20% jitter. CancelAllOrders signal after 3 consecutive failures.
- **BGeometrics On-Chain** — `insight/onchain.rs`: Replaced dead CoinMetrics/CoinGecko (403) with BGeometrics API. Free, no key, daily MVRV/SOPR/NUPL. Range validation on all values.

- **RSS Cap + Source Diversity** — `insight/rss.rs`: `fetch_all_feeds_capped()` with per-feed 5s timeout, source diversity (top 2 per source), relevance scoring, cap enforcement.
- **Conditions Summary** — `insight/aggregator.rs`: `conditions_summary()` with SOUL.md thresholds. Actionable market assessments instead of raw data dump. RSS sentiment classification with negation handling.
- **TTL Cache** — `data/cache.rs`: TTL-based cache with LRU eviction. Graceful degradation (serve stale on API failure). Tests included.
- **Training Pipeline** — `engine.rs`: `run_training_batch()` with memory capture, Brier score, confidence distribution, category edge, auto-lessons, knowledge utility update, semantic consolidation, anti-pattern detection. All phases wrapped in error boundaries.
- **Training CLI** — `main.rs`: `savant --test --train` with filters (-c, -a, -n). `savant report --test` for full audit.
- **Training Report** — `monitor/training_report.rs`: P&L simulation, conviction calibration, confidence curve, category edge, anti-patterns, knowledge utility, lessons summary, semantic patterns, recent episodes.
- **SQLite Backup** — `engine.rs`: `backup_databases()` with rolling timestamped backups. Keeps last 7 copies.

### Fixed (FID-012, FID-013, FID-014 — closed 2026-06-01)

- **Confidence Floor** (FID-014) — `decision_parser.rs`: Trades with confidence < 40% automatically downgraded to Hold. Removes the 0-25% confidence bucket (18% accuracy). Highest-impact one-line fix.
- **Short Bias** (FID-014) — `scenarios.rs`: `derive_expected_action()` rebalanced. Capitulation buy signals boosted (2→3), moderate capitulation added (MVRV<1.2+SOPR<1.0), fear signals boosted (1→2), mild fear added (FG≤45). Buy threshold tightened to require `buy > sell`.
- **Vault Wiring** (FID-012, FID-013, FID-014) — `engine.rs`: Training batch now writes to vault. `project_decision()` per scenario, `project_risk_event()` for anti-patterns, `project_sandbox()` for batch report. 5 empty vault folders populated.
- **Training Default** (FID-014) — `engine.rs`, `main.rs`: `--train` defaults to 5 runs (was 20). `--train --full` for 20 runs. Help text updated.

- **/api/training** — Endpoint returning training metrics, config, episode count.

### Changed

- **Double-sleep bug fixed** — Engine had `time::sleep()` followed by `tokio::select!` with another sleep. Removed extra sleep.
- **Dry-run uses build_context()** — Same path as live engine. No custom prompt building.
- **Debug logging in engine** — Phase 1 and Phase 2 have debug-level logging.
- **Knowledge JSON files** — All 10 files migrated: priorities 2-5, risk catch-alls trimmed, execution units given conditions.
- **Max retries reduced** — 1 streaming + 1 fallback = 2 total per pair (was 3+1=4).
- **LLM timeout increased** — 180s (was 90s). Handles large prompts.

### Fixed

- Context tag format mismatch — Tags were plain words, knowledge units use prefixed format.
- Risk catch-all conditions — 301/350 risk units always matched. Trimmed by content.
- Execution units invisible — 0 conditions → [Trending, Ranging].
- Kraken funding rate garbage — -45% per 8hr. Replaced with OKX (0.01%).
- Dead on-chain APIs — CoinMetrics/CoinGecko 403. Replaced with BGeometrics.
- RSS bloat — 333 items when config says 10. Cap enforced.
- Format string errors in action test output.

- **Persistent Training Pipeline** — `engine.rs`: `run_action_test()` and `run_training()` with memory capture, Brier score, confidence distribution, category edge, auto-lesson generation, progressive difficulty, convergence detection.
- **6th Prompt Layer Wiring** — Memory context now includes semantic patterns + anti-patterns alongside win rates and recent episodes.
- **Knowledge Selection Overhaul** — Indicator-derived conditions (RSI/ADX/EMA/volume → MarketCondition). Context tags use prefixed format matching knowledge vocabulary (`regime_subtype:trending` not `strong_trend`). Unit cap (20). Scoring rebalanced: tags × 3, conditions × 2, priority × 1.
- **Knowledge Priority Migration** — All 2,959 units migrated from uniform priority 5 to differentiated 2-5 based on content specificity. Risk catch-all conditions fixed. Execution units given conditions.

### Changed

- **Double-sleep bug fixed** — Engine had `time::sleep()` followed by `tokio::select!` with another sleep, doubling the tick interval. Removed the extra sleep.
- **Dry-run uses build_context()** — Dry-run now calls the exact same `build_context()` as the live engine. No more custom prompt building.
- **Debug logging in engine** — Phase 1 (candle fetch, order book, higher TF, pre-filter) and Phase 2 (LLM streaming) have debug-level logging for hang diagnosis.
- **Knowledge JSON files** — All 10 files migrated: priorities 2-5, risk catch-alls trimmed, execution units given [Trending, Ranging] conditions.

### Fixed

- Context tag format mismatch — Tags were plain words (`oversold`, `strong_trend`) but knowledge units use prefixed format (`regime_subtype:capitulation`, `setup_type:breakout`). Zero overlap meant zero tag matching. Fixed to use matching format.
- Risk catch-all conditions — 301/350 risk units had 5+ conditions (ExtremeFear, ExtremeGreed, HighVolatility, LowVolatility + more), always matching regardless of market state. Trimmed by content relevance.
- Execution units invisible — 282 execution units had zero conditions, never selected by the condition filter. Added [Trending, Ranging].
- Format string errors in action test output.
